Introduction
------------

Scientific computing is often called the "Third Pillar of Science", 
along with Theory and Experiment. Why? Computation allows us to explore 
models in a way we cannot do with analytic theory (think cosmological 
simulations, protein folding, computational fluid dynamics). Advances 
in algorithms and computational hardware make this an exciting and 
ever-growing field!

The goal of this handbook is to offer a practical guide for foundations 
and common algorithms used in scientific computing. We will illustrate 
important concepts and provide code in C++, Python, and Julia -- three 
common languages used for developing scientific computing applications. 
We will use best software practices where we can, but the main goal of 
the handbook is to discuss algorithms and implement them from scratch 
to gain insights into them.
